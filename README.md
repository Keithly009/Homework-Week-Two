# Keith-Ly-Portfolio 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The purpose of this project is to develop a portfolio for both myself and others to view. 
The purpose is furthered by it being something that I can showcase the work that I have done to others that may employ me and as such it is a way that I can show
the skills that I have acquired during this course and even beyond that. 
This should solve the problems of having anyone ask me questions regarding the skillsets that I possess. 
I have learned that I will need to significantly improve how intimate my knowledge of both HTML and CSS both in order to improve my efficiency in performing a variety
of tasks that my future clients and employers will request.
